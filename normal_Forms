1NF :
	no multivalued attributes or a cell cannot have more than values
2NF :
	no partial dependency
		non-prime attributes should not depend on part of candidate key
3NF :
	no trasitive dependecy
		non-prime ->non-prime
BCNF :
	alpha -> beta 
		beta : don't care
		alpha: super key 
			super key : any set of attribute whose subset is a candidate key
example : R(A,B,C)
	AB -> C 
	C -> B
		(AB) , (AC) are the candidate key
		is in 3NF but not in BCNF because of 2nd dependency
